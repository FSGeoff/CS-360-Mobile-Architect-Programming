# Android Inventory App

### The Inventory App is designed to efficiently address the user needs of tracking items in a warehouse. The key goals and requirements of the app include:

+ **Database Management:** The app must have a database with at least two tables for storing inventory items and user logins/passwords.
+ **User Authentication:** Provide a login screen for users to log in or create a new account if they haven't logged in before.
+ **Inventory Management:** Include features to add, remove, increase, or decrease the number of items in the inventory.
+ **Notification System:** Notify users when the quantity of any item in the inventory reaches zero.

### To support these user needs and create a user-centered UI, the following screens and features are necessary:

+ **Login Screen:** For user authentication and account creation.
+ **Inventory Grid Screen:** Displaying all items in the inventory with options to add, remove, and adjust quantities.
+ **Notification System:** Implement a mechanism to notify users when an item's quantity reaches zero.

The UI designs focus on simplicity, intuitive navigation, clear labeling, and feedback mechanisms to keep users engaged and informed. The designs make it easy for users to perform tasks such as adding/removing items and receiving notifications.

In coding the app, I approached it by using modern development practices such as MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, implementing robust error handling, following best coding practices, and utilizing version control systems like Git for collaboration and code management. These

Typically, to ensure the code's functionality, I would conduct thorough testing using unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Testing is essential to validate that the app behaves as expected, identify bugs or issues early in the development cycle, and ensure a smooth user experience. 
However, I could not thoroughly test the code because my Android Studio Application had technical difficulties.

I must confess that Java is not my most robust language, so I'm proud of what I accomplished. I am most proud of the Home/Login screen.
